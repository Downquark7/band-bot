# band-bot

Hi there, I'm CarichnerBot! A lot of what I do is respond to certain keywords or react to certain messages, but I do have some commands:

`!help`: Shows this message.

`!talk`: Generates a string of gibberish using Markov Chains. Disclaimer: may be innapropriate at times.

`!generatememe`: This generates a meme with whatever image you attach to your message, along with whatever text you provide it. For example, you can do `!generatememe Meme Text Here`, and it will generate a meme with that text at the bottom of your image. Alternatively, you can use `!generatememe !talk` or `!generatememe !random` to generate a meme with gibberish text.

`!uptime`: Shows the uptime for the bot.

`!date`: Displays the current date and time.

`!ping`: Shows the current ping for the bot.
